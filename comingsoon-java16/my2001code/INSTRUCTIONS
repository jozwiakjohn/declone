
hi, it is afternoon on october 15 2001 and i am john.

here are the compiler, assembler, disassembler, and tools for syntax files
used as a shell around motorola's eric buhrke speechrecognizer.

one needs a version of "make" and java jdk (Sun's jdk 1.3 works).

the directory "syntaxes" contains example gsl and abnf syntax files.
the directory "tmp" which is not "/tmp" contains output from running tests.

make                = builds the tools.
make clean          = removes the things built.
make testlexicon    = tests the (english) lexicon.
make testabnftogsl  = tests the converter's ability to do the obvious.
java Converter      = just gives instructions on how to invoke the compiler.
java LexiconEnglish = runs diagnostics on the english lexicon.
java VirtualMachine = just gives instructions 
                      on how to invoke the various virtual machines to do
                      forensics, 
                      leftrecursion detection, and
                      disassembly of binaries.

for requests for new functionalities, write jozwiak@unimodular.com
since that is an external email address i can see anywhere, even if 
they cancel us all and still employ janiece webb.

wishing all well,
john
